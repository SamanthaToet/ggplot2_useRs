## Back to why we're all here: ggplot

The grammar of graphics assembles plots in layers, and each layer is relatively independent. 

That means you create your graph in a series of independent actions: 

1. creating the plot and assigning the axes 
2. building a geometric object from your data
3. mapping variables as different aesthetics

## What is ggplot?

These layers are the foundation that you can use to make *any* type of plot:

<div class = "centered">
![](layers.png)
</div>

## Aesthetic Mappings 

<div class = "centered">
![](aes.png)
</div>



Essentially, any time there is a variable that you want to look at, put it in the mappings. This is where you tell ggplot what the x and y variables are, in addition to any other variables that you want to explore. 

You can also change what variables are being mapped within layers... weâ€™ll get back to that though.

## For Example {.smaller}

In this scatterplot we're mapping carat to x, price to y, and cut to color:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, col = cut)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Geom functions
